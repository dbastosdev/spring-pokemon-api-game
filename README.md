## üíª Project

<p align="center">
  <img alt="model" src="https://github.com/dbastosdev/spring-pokemon-api/blob/main/model.png" width="50%">
</p>

The project was made to study how access external services with Rest template. For this, I built a system that can search pokemons by name and get the main informations about them. With this data, I wrote a simple game logic based in RPG to create this app. 

The game use the pokemons associated a each Pokemon master and simulate a battle in turns called rounds. Dices d100 are used to make attacks and defenses with sucess if them are minor than values of pokemons. D10 are used to make damage.

A complete use case can see below. Enjoy it!
